1. Database Structure
Friends Table: Create a friends table to store friend relationships.
Columns: user_id, friend_id, status (e.g., pending, accepted).
Ensure that user_id and friend_id pairs are unique.
Consider indexing both user_id and friend_id for quick lookup.
Friend Requests Table (optional): Alternatively, you could create a separate friend_requests table if you want to keep the friends table clean for only confirmed friendships.
Event Participation:
Ensure your events participation table (if it’s separate) links user_id with event_id.
Optionally add a timestamp for when the user attended to track historical attendance.
2. Backend Logic
Sending Friend Requests:
Check if a request already exists or if the users are already friends.
Insert a new entry in friends with status = pending.
Accepting Friend Requests:
Update the status to accepted in the friends table once a request is approved.
Consider adding a notification or confirmation message on acceptance.
Rejecting/Blocking Requests:
You may want a mechanism to delete or block requests (e.g., status = rejected), though this can be deferred until there’s demand.
Listing Friends:
Query all rows in the friends table where status = accepted for a given user_id.
Mutual Friends:
Write a query to check for mutual friends (e.g., user A’s friends intersected with user B’s friends).
Friend Suggestions:
Suggest friends based on:
Mutual friends: Users with the most mutual friends with the current user.
Shared events: Users who frequently attend events with the user.
3. Event-Related Friend Interactions
Seeing Friends at Events:
Create a query that checks the events_participation table for which friends attended a specific event (e.g., user_id has friends who also have entries for event_id).
Shared Events List:
Provide a way to view past events attended with friends.
For each event, list friends who attended alongside the user.
Notifications for Friend Activity:
Optionally, add notifications when a friend attends an event or RSVPs.
Track whether a user has seen each notification to avoid redundant alerts.
4. Frontend/UI Considerations
Friend Requests UI:
Display friend requests with options to accept or reject.
Show a list of pending requests for each user.
Friend List Display:
Add a friend list page or component where users can see their friends and recent shared events.
Include a search function to find friends easily.
Event Attendance Visibility:
Display friends attending an event when viewing event details.
Add a simple count (e.g., “3 friends attending”) for an at-a-glance view.
5. Performance and Indexing
Frequent Queries:
Optimize queries for retrieving friends, especially for larger user bases.
Ensure indexes on user_id, friend_id, and event_id columns in relevant tables to speed up friendship and event attendance lookups.
Caching:
Consider caching common queries (e.g., friend lists, event attendees) to reduce load on the database.
6. Testing and Error Handling
Database Consistency:
Test for scenarios where users try to add the same friend multiple times or accidentally send multiple requests.
Edge Cases:
Check cases like when a friend request is pending, one user deletes their account, or a friend attends a private event.
Consider scenarios with multiple friend requests between the same users (e.g., user A requests user B and vice versa).
