  You are a campus event tagger. Your job is to reason whether given tags apply to a specific event.

  Given is an email sent by an MIT student to the dorm spam mailing list (i.e. to all MIT undergrads).
  The email has been identified to contain the following event:

  Title: {INSERT TITLE HERE}

  "Theater",
  "Concert",
  "Talk",
  "Study Break",
  "Movie Screening",
  "Game",
  "Sale",
  "Rally",
  "Dance",
  "Party",
  "Class Presentation"
];

const EVENT_FORM_TAG_OUTPUT_SCHEMA: JSONSchema7 = {
  properties: {
    form_tag: {
      type: "string",
      description: "The tag of the form of the event.",
      enum: ACCEPTABLE_FORM_TAGS
    }
  },
  required: ["form_tag"]
};

const FORM_TAG_PROMPT =
  PROMPT_INTRO +
  dedent`
  The email body might contain multiple events, but you only need to identify the form tag for the event above.

  Start with the form of the event. Possible event forms (choose the closest one) (after | is explanation, not part of tag):
  - Theater | (plays, musicals, theatrical performances, improv shows)
  - Concert | (musical performances, a cappella shows, orchestral performances)
  - Talk | (lectures, seminars, workshops, panel discussions, information sessions)
  - Movie Screening | (film showings, documentary screenings, movie nights)
  - Game | (game nights, tournaments, competitions, hackathons, puzzlehunts)
  - Sale | (fundraising events, charity drives, auctions, markets)
  - Dance | (dance performances, dance workshops, dance parties)
  - Rally | (demonstrations, protests, awareness campaigns)
  - Party | (social gatherings, celebrations, carnivals, festivals, receptions)
  - Class Presentation | (student project showcases, demos, thesis presentations)
  - Study Break | (relaxing events with refreshments, de-stress activities)

  Analyze each potential form tag systematically:
  1. Consider the primary activity/format of the event
  2. Review the descriptions for each tag to find the best match
  3. For ambiguous cases, prioritize the most specific category that applies
  4. If multiple tags seem applicable, choose the one that best captures the main focus

  Go through each tag above and give reasons whether each tag applies. Then finally give the tag you choose and why you choose it.

  Your answer must begin with: "Out of the the tags [${ACCEPTABLE_FORM_TAGS.join(", ")}]..."

//---------------------- CONTENT TAG EXTRACTION  ----------------------//
const ACCEPTABLE_CONTENT_TAGS = [
  "EECS",
  "AI",
  "Math",
  "Biology",
  "Finance",
  "Career",
  "East Asian",
  "Religion",

];

const EVENT_CONTENT_TAG_OUTPUT_SCHEMA: JSONSchema7 = {

    content_tag_1: {
      type: "string",
      description: "The first tag of the content of the event. (not necessary)",
      enum: ACCEPTABLE_CONTENT_TAGS
    },
    content_tag_2: {
      type: "string",
      description: "The second tag of the content of the event (not necessary).",
      enum: ACCEPTABLE_CONTENT_TAGS
    }
  },
  required: []
}

const CONTENT_TAG_PROMPT =
  PROMPT_INTRO +
  dedent`
  The email body might contain multiple events, but you only need to identify the (up to two) content tags for the event above.

  The event's content focuses on (choose at most two, don't have to choose any if not relevant):
  - EECS | (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, including topics in software, hardware, and related areas)
  - AI
  - Math
  - Biology
  - Finance | (including Quant)
  - Career | (related to jobs and industries)
  - East Asian
  - Religion
  - Queer | (only if LGBTQ+ is specifically mentioned. Mentioning of a queer color doesn't count.)

  Analysis process:
  1. Review the event title and description for subject matter keywords
  2. Consider the organizer (departments/clubs often indicate the subject area)
  3. Identify the primary academic or cultural domains being addressed
  4. Select the most relevant tag(s) based on specific terminology in the text
  5. For interdisciplinary events, select the two most prominent domains

  First carefully analyze each tag with evidence from the event description, then output ONLY a JSON object in this exact format:

  For two tags:
  {
    "content_tag_1": "TAG_NAME",
    "content_tag_2": "TAG_NAME"
  }

  For one tag:
  {
    "content_tag_1": "TAG_NAME"
  }

  For no tags:
  {}

  Example output for an AI workshop event:
  {
    "content_tag_1": "AI",
    "content_tag_2": "EECS"
  }

  DO NOT include any other text before or after the JSON object.

      type: "string",
      description: "The tag of the amenities of the event (not necessary).",
      enum: ACCEPTABLE_AMENITIES_TAGS
    },
    type_of_food: {
      type: "string",
      description: "What food the event provides, if tagged with 'Free Food'."
    }
  },
  required: ["amenities_tag", "type_of_food"]
};

const AMENITIES_TAG_PROMPT =
  PROMPT_INTRO +
  dedent`
  The email body might contain multiple events, but you only need to identify whether the specified event contains food or boba.

  Carefully analyze the event description for any mentions of:
  - Free food, refreshments, or snacks
  - Specific food items (pizza, cookies, etc.)
  - Drinks, especially bubble tea or boba
  - Terms like "provided", "served", "catered"

  Look for both explicit mentions ("Free pizza will be served") and implicit indications ("Join us for dinner and discussion").

  If you think the email mentions food, snacks, or boba, highlight the exact text that indicates this and explain your reasoning.

  If you think the email does not mention food, snacks, or boba, explain why the event is unlikely to provide any edible items.

  At the end of your reasoning, select the most appropriate tag from [${ACCEPTABLE_AMENITIES_TAGS.join(", ")}]:
  - "Free Food" if food is explicitly mentioned as free
  - "Boba" if bubble tea/boba is specifically mentioned (prioritize this if both food and boba are available)
  - "Food" if food is mentioned but not explicitly free
  - "None" if no food or drinks are mentioned
