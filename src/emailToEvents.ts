    Hi Dormspammer!

  <p>
    Our large language model just parsed your email and identified the following event(s):

  {EVENTS}
  <p>
    You can find your event(s) at <a
    href="https://dormsoup.mit.edu">dormsoup.mit.edu</a> and edit any of the
    above details.

  <p>
    If you have any questions, feel free to contact <a

    href="https://dormsoup.mit.edu/about">our about page</a> for our data
    privacy policy. If you would like our model to NOT parse your emails,
    include "dormsoup-ignore" anywhere in your email.
