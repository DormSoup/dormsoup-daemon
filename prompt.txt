Subject: CyberMath Academy Summer Math Camps on July 17-28, 2023 -- employment opportunity!
[cid:image001.jpg@01D961B6.A15FC2D0]

Ivy League Summer Math Camps & STEM Camps
July 17 - 28, 2023 at Harvard Faculty Club

Requirements:
* Must be eligible to work in the United States of America
* Must hold a high school diploma or equivalent and be at least 18 years of age as of July 17, 2023

Classes will be held at Harvard Faculty Club, 20 Quincy St, Cambridge, MA 02138. (Residential students will stay at Harvard Square.) Transportation to and from the Harvard University campus will be provided by CyberMath Academy.

Courses
* Advanced Middle School Math (Foundations/Mastery Levels)

Although this course is typically recommended for students in grades 4th-8th, and anyone in 8th grade or below may enroll, we encourage younger students to participate as well!
Course Description:

This course will familiarize students with the essential concepts and techniques in Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Geometry, Number Theory and Combinatorics. We will have a specific emphasis on problem solving where the students will constantly be challenged to think creatively.

* Advanced High School Math (Foundations/Mastery Levels)
Overview:

This course covers the entire high school curriculum including: trigonometry, advanced algebra, precalculus and advanced geometry, but excludes calculus. Our curriculum also includes some additional challenging and brain-stimulating topics outside of the traditional school curriculum.
Recommended Grade Levels:

Students are expected to actively participate in class. We will employ the Socratic method, which is a cooperative dialogue between the students and teacher to stimulate critical thinking. Students will also collaborate with classmates while solving challenging problems.

There will be a separate teacher for each of the four courses, possibly more. If a course has over 20 students, we will split it into multiple sections, and each section will require its own instructor.

Teaching obligations

Instructors will be teaching their courses every weekday from July 17-28, for 6 hours each day, as well as tutoring and supervising students at nightly study time sessions for 1.5 hours per instruction day. The daily schedule is as follows:

7:15 am - 8:15 am: Breakfast

8:15 am - 8:45 am: Day students arrive

9:00 am - 1:00 pm: Morning classes

10:45 pm: Lights out

Instructors will also be required to administer (at least) one midterm assessment (not necessarily a traditional exam), and one final assessment, as well as determine final letter grades (on a traditional A-F scale) for each student. They will also be required to report feedback/comments/suggestions for improvement/recommendations for future study to each student and their parents.

Financial logistics

For payment/salary details, please contact our CEO, Andy Gokce, at info@cybermath.academy. (In 2022, the salary was $2500 for 60 total hours of instruction, not including prior preparation of materials.)

Travel and accommodation expenditures will be covered by CyberMath Academy. Lunch and dinner will be provided to all students by Harvard University. Faculty may choose their own meals and request reimbursement following the camp.

We look forward to seeing you in July, and to seeing you spread your knowledge of and passion for math to our eager students!

VR/AR at MIT Presents:

Martin Waehlisch, Head of the Innovation Team at the UN DPPA

Pizza Provided
6-7pm Monday April 3rd Room 3-333

[cid:26aeaef9-e5ba-4bf4-b675-6e0ff5666825]


The UN has been turning to immersive technologies to advance diplomacy and peacebuilding. The aim has been to explore how VR could advance empathy and how the Metaverse could be used for public engagement in peace processes. First pilots on using XR for enhancing situational awareness and supporting decision-making have been successful, but many questions about the responsible use of technology remain.


Join us for an evening discussion as Dr. Martin Waehlisch, head of the Innovation Team at the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (UN DPPA), shares his insights on innovation efforts and the VR work in the UN. Dr. Waehlisch leads a unit that is dedicated to exploring, piloting, and implementing new approaches to conflict prevention, mediation, and peacebuilding. He has supported peace processes around the world and has published widely on international conflict resolution, emerging technologies and futures thinking. He will share personal lessons learnt from recent VR productions in Colombia, Yemen, and Lebanon.


The presentation is followed by a Q&A session and pizza. We will also have headsets available to try out some of the UN VR experiences. Everybody is warmly invited.
